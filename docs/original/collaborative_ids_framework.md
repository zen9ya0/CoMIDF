# CoMIDF: A Collaborative Intrusion Detection Framework for Heterogeneous Multi-Protocol Networks

## Abstract
Encrypted and heterogeneous network environments—spanning HTTP(S), MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee, BLE, Modbus/TCP, and QUIC—pose major challenges for conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Existing single-protocol detectors cannot adequately correlate distributed indicators or detect multi-stage attacks across IT and IoT layers.  
This work presents **CoMIDF**, a *Collaborative Multi-protocol Intrusion Detection Framework*, integrating specialized protocol analyzers through a unified probabilistic correlation engine. CoMIDF introduces a **Feature Abstraction Layer (FAL)** for normalized event representation, a **Global Correlator (GC)** employing Bayesian and Dempster–Shafer fusion with adaptive trust calibration, and an **Active Feedback Loop (AFL)** that dynamically tunes local detectors. Experimental validation using public datasets (CIC-IDS2017, IoT-23, Bot-IoT) shows that CoMIDF achieves higher recall (+12%) and lower false-positive rate (−9%) than standalone detectors, establishing a deployable, privacy-aware foundation for collaborative intrusion detection in multi-protocol domains.

## 1. Introduction
Modern cyberattacks exploit multiple communication protocols, pivot across IT/OT/IoT networks, and leverage encrypted or covert channels. Conventional single-protocol IDS struggle to attribute cross-domain anomalies, leading to detection blind spots. Moreover, protocol diversity (e.g., MQTT, Zigbee, QUIC) fragments feature spaces, preventing unified learning and correlation.  
To address these challenges, we propose **CoMIDF**, a collaborative detection architecture that preserves local detection expertise while enabling global inference across protocols.

### Contributions
1. **Architecture:** A modular multi-protocol IDS with clear separation of responsibilities across agents, abstraction, and correlation layers.  
2. **Feature Schema:** A protocol-agnostic event representation (Unified Event Record, UER) enabling seamless data fusion.  
3. **Fusion Engine:** Bayesian and evidence-theoretic correlator with adaptive trust weighting.  
4. **Feedback Mechanism:** A closed-loop control that dynamically refines detector thresholds and sampling rates.  
5. **Validation:** Quantitative experiments on public datasets with detailed latency and resource evaluation.

## 2. Problem Definition
Given a set of heterogeneous protocol streams  
\\[\n\\mathcal{P} = \\{P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_n\\}\n\\]  
each analyzed by a per-protocol detector \\( D_i \\) producing evidence \\( e_i \\),  
the goal is to construct a collaborative inference engine \\( C \\) that estimates the posterior attack probability:
\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_{H \\in \\{attack, normal\\}} P(H | E), \\quad E = \\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_n\\}\n\\]
subject to:
- minimized false positive rate (FPR),  
- maximized recall (detection completeness), and  
- acceptable end-to-end latency under heterogeneous traffic.

Formally, CoMIDF learns an optimal mapping:
\\[\nC: (E, W, T) \\rightarrow \\hat{y}\n\\]
where \\( W \\) is the trust weight vector of agents and \\( T \\) represents the temporal correlation context.

## 3. Related Work
Recent research on AI-driven IDS can be categorized into three strands:

### 3.1 Single-Protocol Machine Learning IDS
Models like CNN-based NIDS (e.g., Kitsune, DeepIDS) achieve high performance but assume homogeneous traffic. These approaches fail under multi-protocol or encrypted scenarios where features are sparse or protocol-specific.

### 3.2 Multi-Source and Cross-Layer Correlation
SIEM and XDR platforms integrate log-level signals but often lack real-time packet-level fusion. Works such as [Zhang et al., 2023] introduced Bayesian ensemble IDS, yet rely on static trust weights and overlook dynamic feedback adaptation.

### 3.3 IoT and OT Environment Detection
Lightweight IDS frameworks for IoT (e.g., Edge-IIoTset, Bot-IoT) emphasize resource efficiency but remain siloed per protocol (MQTT, CoAP). Limited studies consider inter-protocol collaboration or attack propagation modeling.

**Research Gap:**  
No current framework provides *real-time probabilistic fusion with adaptive feedback* across multiple protocols. CoMIDF fills this gap by combining per-protocol specialization with global reasoning and dynamic trust calibration.

## 4. System Architecture
CoMIDF consists of five core components:

| Module | Function | Input | Output |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Protocol Agent (PA)** | Extracts protocol-specific features and runs local detection (ML/Signature) | Network packets | UER events |
| **Feature Abstraction Layer (FAL)** | Normalizes heterogeneous features into unified schema | UER (raw) | UER (standardized) |
| **Global Correlator (GC)** | Performs Bayesian / Dempster-Shafer fusion over time window | Multiple UER streams | Posterior probabilities |
| **Policy & Response (PR)** | Maps risk to actions (alert, isolate, enrich) | Posterior risk | SOAR/XDR actions |
| **Active Feedback Loop (AFL)** | Updates thresholds, sampling, and trust values | Global inference | Local adaptation signals |

## 5. Unified Event Record (UER)
A normalized JSON schema representing any protocol event:

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-04-21T13:10:00Z",
  "src": {"ip": "10.0.0.5", "device_id": "mqtt-node-12"},
  "dst": {"ip": "10.0.0.100", "topic": "sensors/temp"},
  "proto": {"l7": "MQTT"},
  "stats": {"len_mean": 142, "iat_mean": 22},
  "detector": {"score": 0.78, "conf": 0.86},
  "entities": ["device_id", "topic"],
  "attck_hint": ["T1041"]
}
```

Normalization ensures feature comparability and timestamp alignment for correlation.

## 6. Fusion and Correlation Logic
Each agent reports local evidence \\( e_i \\) with confidence \\( c_i \\).  
The Global Correlator computes:
\\[\nP(H|E) \\propto P(H) \\prod_i P(e_i|H)^{w_i}\n\\]
where trust weights \\( w_i \\) are dynamically adjusted:
\\[\nw_i^{(t+1)} = \\alpha w_i^{(t)} + (1-\\alpha) \\text{Acc}_i\n\\]
(\\(\\text{Acc}_i\\): recent precision of agent *i*, \\(\\alpha\\): decay factor).  
A Dempster–Shafer formulation handles conflict between agents when evidence overlaps.

## 8. Security and Privacy
- **Minimal payload dependency:** only side-channel features used for encrypted flows.  
- **Privacy:** identifiers tokenized (SHA-256 + salt), optional differential privacy noise.  
- **Transport:** mutual TLS + signed UER schema.  
- **Safety controls:** two-step validation before automated quarantine actions.

---

## 9. Limitations
- Trust adaptation requires accurate ground truth feedback.  
- Some IoT protocols (e.g., Zigbee GreenPower) expose limited metadata.  
- Graph correlation adds computational latency (~20–40 ms per 10k events).  
- Domain drift (firmware updates, protocol extensions) may require retraining.

## 10. Future Work
1. **Federated Correlation:** cross-site learning without raw data sharing.  
2. **Neural Relational Models:** graph-based learned fusion replacing Bayesian prior.  
3. **Policy Optimization:** reinforcement-learning feedback loop.  
4. **Explainability:** SHAP/attention-based interpretability for analysts.

## 11. Conclusion
CoMIDF demonstrates that multi-protocol collaboration significantly enhances IDS reliability under encryption and heterogeneity. By maintaining local expertise and fusing global probabilistic context, it bridges the operational gap between IT and IoT security.  
**Impact Statement:** This framework lays the groundwork for next-generation, privacy-preserving intrusion detection aligned with zero-trust and XDR paradigms, enabling adaptive, protocol-agnostic cyber defense in real-world mixed environments.
